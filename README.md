# Javascript-Frontend-Challenges
A repo containing Javascript challenges, and frontend challenges in General

The Folder - 5 Basic Javascript Projects are a collection of 5 frontend functional javascript web applications.
Namely:
!. A Todo Application
2. An Expense Tracker Application
3. A Note Taking Application
4. A Vowel Counter Application
5. A Memory Game (Card Memory Game)

NB: The Memory Card Game logic isn't 100% as when two images have been matched, it can still be reselected and be added as a win. Hence when playing the game, do not click on any image that has been won. only select cards faced down
